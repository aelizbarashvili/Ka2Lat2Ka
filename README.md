1.Python scripts (ka2lat.py and lat2kat.py):
–ka2lat.pyscript utilized a translation table (ka2lat) for mapping Georgian to Latin characters.
–Processed a sample file, demonstrating the conversion of Georgian characters to basic Latin characters.
–Two parameters, ”File” and ”Marker,” were used to specify the file path and define symbols for marking non-Georgian characters.
–Reverted the translated file back to the original Georgian characters using a translation table (lat2kat) with the script lat2kat.py.
–Similar to the transliteration script, it used parameters ”File” and ”Marker”for file path and symbol definition.

2.Shell Command (ka2lat2ka.sed):
–Introduced a sed command for transliteration and detransliteration.
–Demonstrated the use of markers for identifying non-Georgian characters and translating between Georgian and Latin characters.
–Showed the effectiveness of the shell commands in terms of processing speed, especially when handling larger files.

3.Vim text editor (ka2lat2ka.vim):
–Explored transliteration and detranslation processes using the vim text editor.
–Leveraged Vim’s ex commands to eﬀiciently perform translation tasks.
–Highlighted the advantage of Vim’s buffering mechanism for faster processing.
